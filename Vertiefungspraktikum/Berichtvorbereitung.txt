Theorieteil:

Protein aggregate stability enhancement through addition of exipients
Sucrose is a classical amorphous matrix former while lyophilisation
Stabilisation with sacrose is due to 2 things: water replacement theory and vitrification
water replacement: substitution of water hydroxyl groups with sucrose hydroxyl groups in protein hydrogen bonds, maintaining the protein conformation
Vitrification concept: Reduction of reaction rates of proteins and between protens and water and excipients within the glassy matrix

With DSC the water concentration in MFCS can be determined
